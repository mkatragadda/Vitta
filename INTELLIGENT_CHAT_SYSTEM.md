# Intelligent Chat System - Implementation Complete ✅

## Overview

Vitta now has an intelligent, conversational chat system powered by **compromise.js** for local NLP processing with **GPT-3.5 fallback** for complex queries. The system understands natural language, extracts entities, maintains conversation context, and provides dynamic, contextual responses.

---

## 🎯 Key Features

### 1. **Intent Classification (compromise.js)**
- Uses NLP to understand user intent from natural language
- Supports 15 core intents with flexible pattern matching
- Confidence scoring to determine when to use GPT fallback
- No hardcoded regex - all patterns defined in JSON

### 2. **Entity Extraction**
- Automatically extracts:
  - **Merchants**: "Costco", "Target", "Whole Foods"
  - **Card names**: "Chase Sapphire", "Amex Gold"
  - **Timeframes**: "today", "this week", "in 5 days"
  - **Amounts**: "$500", "1000 dollars"
  - **Screen names**: "wallet", "optimizer"

### 3. **Conversation Memory (localStorage)**
- Stores conversation history across sessions
- Maintains context for multi-turn conversations
- Remembers up to 50 recent exchanges
- Provides context to GPT when needed

### 4. **GPT-3.5 Fallback**
- Automatically falls back to GPT-3.5 for complex queries
- Only triggers when local NLP confidence is low
- Includes user's card data in context
- Respects conversation history for continuity

### 5. **Dynamic Response Generation**
- Responses based on actual user data
- Contextual suggestions with deep links
- Adaptive tone based on urgency
- No template-based hardcoded responses

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### 1. **Install Dependencies**
Already installed: `compromise` (NLP library)

### 2. **Configure OpenAI API (Optional)**
To enable GPT-3.5 fallback, add to `.env.local`:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

**Note**: The system works WITHOUT the API key - it just won't use GPT fallback for complex queries.

### 3. **Run the App**
```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to http://localhost:3000 and start chatting!

✅ "How much credit is available?"
✅ "Show APR"
```

### **Complex/Natural Queries** (triggers GPT if API key is set)

## 🔍 How It Works

### Processing Pipeline

```
User Query
    ↓
[1] Intent Classification (compromise.js)
    - Extract verbs, nouns, questions
    - Score against 15 intent patterns
    - Calculate confidence
    ↓
[2] Entity Extraction
    - Identify merchants, cards, times, amounts
    - Use NLP + pattern matching
    ↓
[3] Decision Point
    ├─ High Confidence → [4] Local Response
    └─ Low Confidence → [5] GPT-3.5 Fallback
    ↓
[6] Response Generation
    - Use actual user card data
    - Include deep links
    - Contextual suggestions
    ↓
[7] Save to localStorage
    - Store for conversation history
    - Provide context for next query
    ↓
Display to User
```

## 🎓 Adding New Intents

To add a new intent, edit `data/intents.json`:

```json
{
  "id": "new_intent",
  "name": "New Intent",
  "description": "What this intent does",
  "patterns": [
    "pattern 1",
    "pattern 2"
  ],
  "keywords": ["keyword1", "keyword2"],
  "requiredEntities": ["entity_type"],
  "action": "action_name",
  "confidence_threshold": 0.7
}
```

Then add a handler in `services/chat/responseGenerator.js`:

```javascript
case 'new_intent':
  return handleNewIntent(cards, entities);
```

## 🔒 Privacy & Data

- **Conversation history**: Stored locally in browser localStorage
- **No server storage**: All NLP processing happens client-side
- **GPT fallback**: Only sends anonymized card data if API key is configured
- **User control**: Conversation history can be cleared anytime

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- [ ] Multi-language support
- [ ] Suggested quick replies
- [ ] Conversation export
- [ ] Custom intent training
- [ ] Sentiment analysis
- [ ] Proactive suggestions
